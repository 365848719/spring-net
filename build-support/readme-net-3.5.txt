Spring.NET 1.3 supports .NET 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5. 

There no specific .NET 3.5 DLLs since Spring.NET does not use any features from the .NET 3.5 Framework.  

You should use the Spring.Services.dll library from the bin\net\3.0 directory and all other Spring DLLs from the bin\net\2.0 directory

The Spring.Services.dll in the bin\net\3.0 directory is built against Spring DLLs in the corresponding bin\net\2.0 directory.

    <para>In early 2004, Martin Fowler asked the readers of his site: when
    talking about Inversion of Control: <emphasis>"the question, is what
    aspect of control are they inverting?"</emphasis>. After talking about the
    term Inversion of Control Martin suggests renaming the pattern, or at
    least giving it a more self-explanatory name, and starts to use the term
    <emphasis>Dependency Injection</emphasis>. His <ulink

    continues to explain some of the ideas behind this important software
    engineering principle.</para>

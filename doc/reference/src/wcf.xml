    <para>Spring's WCF support allows you to configure your WCF services via
    dependency injection and add additional behavior to them using
    Aspect-Oriented programming (AOP).</para>

    <para>There are two approaches in the 1.2 M1 release for configuring your
    services with DI which are discussed in the following sections. One
    approach creates an implementation of your service interface (a dynamic
    proxy) that retrieves a configured instance of your service type from the
    Spring container. This dynamic proxy is then the final service type that
    is hosted. The second approach uses the extension points in WCF itself to
    delegate to the Spring container to create and configure your service
    type. Both approaches are discussed below.</para>

    <para>As it is desirable to have just one approach, we would greatly
    appreciate your input regarding these two approaches as well as any other
    suggestions regarding WCF support.</para>

    <para>For those who would like to get their feet wet right way, check out
    the WcfQuickStart application in the examples directory.</para>

    <title>Configuring WCF services via Dependency Injection</title>

    <para>In this approach the container will creates an implementation of
    your service interface (a dynamic proxy) that retrieves a configured
    instance of your service type from the Spring container. This dynamic
    proxy is then the final service type that is hosted.</para>

    <section id="wcf-di-proxy">
      <title>Dependency Injection using dynamic proxies</title>

      <para>In this approach you develop your WCF services as you would
      normally do. For example here is a sample service type taken from the
      quickstart example.</para>

      <programlisting>    [ServiceContract(Namespace = "http://Spring.WcfQuickStart")]
    public interface ICalculator
    {
        [OperationContract]
        double Add(double n1, double n2);
        [OperationContract]
        double Subtract(double n1, double n2);
        [OperationContract]
        double Multiply(double n1, double n2);
        [OperationContract]
        double Divide(double n1, double n2);
        [OperationContract]
        string GetName();
    }</programlisting>

      <para>The implementation for the methods is fairly obvious but an
      additional property, <literal>SleepInSeconds</literal>, is present. This
      is the property we will configure via dependency injection. Here is a
      partial listing of the implementation</para>

      <programlisting>    public class CalculatorService : ICalculator
    {
        private int sleepInSeconds;

        public int SleepInSeconds
        {
            get { return sleepInSeconds; }
            set { sleepInSeconds = value; }
        }

        public double Add(double n1, double n2)
        {
            Thread.Sleep(sleepInSeconds*1000);
            return n1 + n2;

        }


        //  additional implementation not shown for brevity

    }</programlisting>

      <para>To configure this object with Spring, provide the XML
      configuration metadata as shown below as you would with any Spring
      managed object.</para>

      <programlisting>      &lt;object id="calculator" <emphasis role="bold">singleton="false"</emphasis> type="Spring.WcfQuickStart.CalculatorService, Spring.WcfQuickStart.ServerApp"&gt;
        &lt;property name="SleepInSeconds" value="1"/&gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;
</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>The object must be declared as a 'prototype' object, i.e. not a
        singleton, in order to interact correctly with WCF instancing.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To host this service type in a standalone application define an
      instance of a
      <classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactoryObject</classname>
      and set is property <classname>TargetName</classname> to the id value of
      the previously defined service type.
      <classname>ServiceHostFactoryObject</classname> is a Spring
      <classname>IFactoryObject</classname> implementation. (See <link
      linkend="objects-factory-extension-factoryobject">here</link> for more
      information on <classname>IFactoryObjects</classname> and their
      interaction with the container.) The
      <classname>ServiceHostFactoryObject</classname> will create an instance
      of
      <classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.SpringServiceHost</classname>
      that will be the ServiceHost instance associated with your service type.
      This configuration for this step is shown below.</para>

      <programlisting>      &lt;object id="calculatorServiceHost" type="Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactoryObject, Spring.Services"&gt;
        &lt;property name="TargetName" value="calculator" /&gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Additional service configuration can be done declaratively in the
      standard App.config file as shown below</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;
  &lt;services&gt;
    &lt;service name="<emphasis role="bold">calculator</emphasis>" behaviorConfiguration="DefaultBehavior"&gt;
      &lt;host&gt; ... &lt;/host&gt;
      &lt;endpoint&gt; ... &lt;/endpoint&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/services&gt;

&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>It is important that the name of the service in the WCF
        declarative configuration section match the name of the Spring object
        definition</para>
      </note>

      <para><classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.SpringServiceHost
      </classname>is where the dynamic proxy for your service type is
      generated. This dynamic proxy will implement a single 'WCF' interface,
      the same on that your service type implements. The implementation of the
      service interface methods on the proxy will delegate to a wrapped
      'target' object which is the object instance retrieved by name from the
      Spring container using the Spring API,
      <classname>ApplicationContext.GetObject(name)</classname>. Since the
      object retrieved in this manner is fully configured, your WCF service is
      as well.</para>

      <para>Outside of a standalone application you can also use the class
      <classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactory</classname>
      (which inherits from
      <classname>System.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactory</classname>)
      to host your services so that they can be configured via dependency
      injection. To use the dynamic proxy approached described here you should
      still refer to the name of the service as the name of the object
      definition used to configure the service type in the Spring
      container.</para>

      <para>There are not many disadvantages to this approach other than the
      need to specify the service name as the name of the object definition in
      the Spring container and to ensure that singleton=false is used in the
      object definition. You can also use
      <classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactory</classname>
      to host your service inside IIS but should still refer to the service by
      the name of the object in the Spring container.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="wcf-di-extension-points">
      <title>Dependency Injection using WCF extensibility points.</title>

      <para>The second approach uses the extensibility points in WCF itself to
      delegate to Spring to create and configure your WCF service. This
      approach was first taken (afaik) by Oran Dennison on his <ulink
      url="http://orand.blogspot.com/2006/10/wcf-service-dependency-injection.html">blog</ulink>
      and several other folks on the web since then. In this approach Spring
      specific implementations of the WCF interfaces
      <classname>System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IInstanceProvider</classname>
      and
      <classname>System.ServiceModel.Description.IServiceBehavior</classname>
      are used to integrate Spring directly into the instancing of WCF
      services.</para>

      <para>Spring's implementation of
      <classname>IInstanceProvider</classname> is
      <classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Support.SpringInstanceProvider</classname>.
      This implementation will look for an object by type in the Spring
      container and retrieve an instance configured using DI. If there is more
      than one object of the type registered with the container than an
      exception will be thrown. The
      <classname>SpringInstanceProvider</classname> is used by a custom
      service behavior class,
      <classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Support.SpringServiceBehavior</classname>
      where it is applied to all the service endpoints. This behavior is then
      added to the custom service host
      <classname>Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.SpringServiceHost</classname></para>

      <para>The service type is used to locate the object in the container. In
      your .svc file you specify the custom service host type and also the
      type of the service. Here is an example taken from the WcfQuickStart
      application that shows the use of this approach inside IIS.</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;%@ ServiceHost Language="C#" Debug="true" Service="Spring.WcfQuickStart.CalculatorService" 
                                           Factory="Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactory" %&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>The Spring configuration for the object is shown below.</para>

      <programlisting>      &lt;object id="calculator" type="Spring.WcfQuickStart.CalculatorService, App_Code" <emphasis
          role="bold">singleton="false"</emphasis>&gt;
        &lt;property name="SleepInSeconds" value="1"/&gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>The object must be declared as a 'prototype' object, i.e. not a
        singleton, in order to interact correctly with WCF instancing.</para>
      </note>

      <para>While integrating 'natively' with WCF does seem to be the most
      natural approach there is one 'gotya' that needs to be investigated
      further to see if there is an acceptable workaround in order for this
      approach to be viable. The issue is that if the service is configured to
      be a singleton, for example using
      <literal>[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.Single)]</literal>
      then the invocation of the <classname>IInstanceProvider</classname> is
      short-circuited. See the notes on the MSDN class documentation <ulink
      url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.dispatcher.iinstanceprovider.aspx">here</ulink>.
      One workaround, which is not very appealing, is to use the PerCall
      instancing mode but set the singleton attribute in the Spring
      configuration to true, this way the same instance is always
      returned.</para>

  <section id="Aspect Oriented Programming">
    <title>Apply AOP advice to WCF services</title>

    <para>In either approach to performing dependency injection you can apply
    additional AOP advice to your WCF services in the same way as you have
    always done in Spring. The following configuration shows how to apply some
    simple performance monitoring advice to all services in the
    <classname>Spring.WcfQuickStart</classname> namespace and is taken from
    the QuickStart example.</para>

    <programlisting>      &lt;object id="serviceOperation" type="Spring.Aop.Support.SdkRegularExpressionMethodPointcut, Spring.Aop"&gt;
        &lt;property name="pattern" value="Spring.WcfQuickStart.*"/&gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;
      
      &lt;object id="perfAdvice" type="Spring.WcfQuickStart.SimplePerformanceInterceptor, Spring.WcfQuickStart.ServerApp"&gt;
        &lt;property name="Prefix" value="Service Layer Performance"/&gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;
      
      &lt;aop:config&gt;
        &lt;aop:advisor pointcut-ref="serviceOperation" advice-ref="perfAdvice"/&gt;
      &lt;/aop:config&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>The aop:config section implicitly uses Spring's autoproxying
    features to add additional behavior to any objects defined in the
    container that match the pointcut criteria.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Creating client side proxies declaratively</title>

    <para>To create a client side proxy based on the use of
    ChannelFactory&lt;T&gt;, you can use this rather ugly 'boiler plate' XML
    snippit that takes uses Spring's support for calling factory methods on
    object instances.</para>

    <programlisting>  &lt;!-- returns ChannelFactory&lt;ICalculator&gt;("calculatorEndpoint").CreateChannel() --&gt;

  &lt;object id="serverAppCalculator" type="Spring.WcfQuickStart.ICalculator, Spring.WcfQuickStart.ClientApp"
          factory-object="serverAppCalculatorChannelFactory"
          factory-method="CreateChannel" /&gt;

  &lt;object id="serverAppCalculatorChannelFactory"
          type="System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory&amp;lt;Spring.WcfQuickStart.ICalculator&gt;, System.ServiceModel"&gt;

    &lt;constructor-arg name="endpointConfigurationName" value="serverAppCalculatorEndpoint" /&gt;

  &lt;/object&gt;</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>This will be shortened using a custom namespce in the 1.2 RC1
      release</para>
    </note>

    <para>The value 'serverAppCalculatorEndpoint' refers to the name of an
    enpoints in the &lt;client&gt; section of the standard WCF configuration
    inside of App.config.</para>
